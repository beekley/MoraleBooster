I started this project because I had a hypothesis that Player 2 in tic tac toe could always force Player 1 to win. After a few different attempts to implement this as an always-losing AI, I came up with a way of proving my hypothesis once and for all!

Unfortunately, I ended up proving it wrong. Player 2 couldn't even force a tie in every possible game. 

But it was fun to build! And I learned a lot about using javascript and jquery, building json objects and designing data trees. There are a few posts about it on my blog (http://uncncntrtd.com/tagged/tictactoe), and I'll probably write about some cool things I did/found.
